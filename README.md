Code and powerpoints for CSCB07 seminars in Summer 2018
I don't know how you could use this for whatever code, but please do not copy and paste any of my code to your assignments or whatever you're doing. If you get in crap it's not my fault.
Also, this is Java 1.6 or 1.8.

Either copy the files / code to a folder for IDE or just use terminal and run
$ javac Dad.java Rar.java
$ java Rar
to see the end result. Make sure they're in the same folder.
